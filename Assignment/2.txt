2) What is programing?
Ans:-
    Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute.

These instructions are written in a programming language (like Python, Java, C, etc.) 
and tell the computer what to do and how to do it.

In simple terms:
   Programming is like giving step-by-step directions to a computer so it can solve problems, 
   perform tasks, or create applications.

For example:

    If you want a computer to add two numbers, you write a small program for it.
    If you want a mobile app or a game, programmers write thousands (or millions) of such instructions.
